## Projects
### Chicken disease classification using Computer vision
[Access Project](https://github.com/Jagannath771/Chicken-Disease-Classification-Project/tree/main)

This project focuses on classifying chicken diseases using computer vision techniques to assist poultry farmers in identifying health issues early. The model leverages the VGG16 architecture with transfer learning to achieve high accuracy in disease detection. Extensive dataset version control was managed using DVC (Data Version Control). Performance metrics were rigorously tested and monitored using MLflow and TensorBoard, providing insights into training and evaluation. The final application was packaged with Docker for portability and deployed in AWS ECS, making it accessible via a Heroku application. This end-to-end solution demonstrates robust deployment practices and scalability, offering a practical tool for improving disease management in poultry farming.

### Customer Churn Prediction
[Access Project](https://github.com/Jagannath771/Customer-Churn-Prediction)

This project is designed to predict customer churn using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The model was trained on a dataset containing customer information, including features such as geography, gender, age, balance, and credit score. By leveraging this data, the MLP model achieves high accuracy in predicting whether a customer is likely to churn. The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface where users can input customer details and receive real-time churn predictions.
